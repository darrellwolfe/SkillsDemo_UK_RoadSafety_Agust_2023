# UK Road Safety Data

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Important Information

The UKRoadSafetyData.zip was provided to me to use as test data
for analysis practice and demonstration.

#### Tools

-   Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
-   Microsoft Excel (Power Query, CSVs)
-   Posit RStudio
-   Tableau Public

#### Languages

-   SQL
-   R

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Dataset First Impressions

-   Upon receiving and extracting the 'UKRoadSafetyData.zip'
    file, I notice there are additional zip files.

-   Within each zip file is a single .csv or .xls file.

-   Several of these files are missing naming conventions that
    match other similar files.

    -   Renamed files for consistency if needed later.

-   The 2015 data is in a single zip, and these are also not
    following later file naming conventions, and yet more 2015
    files exist with apparently duplicate data.

    -   Both 2015 Accidents files begin with '201501BS70001' in
        cell A2 and contain 140057 rows.
    -   But without looking further, there is not guarantee these
        have exactly duplicate data. This will require review.
    -   Checked through Power Query, matching both sets of data
        on for each duplicate (Accidents, Casualties, and
        Vehicles for 2015).
    -   Both sets are a perfect Match. Only need to import one
        set.

-   The Variable Lookup is a set of codes tables. One question is
    whether I will want to keep these as separate tables, or
    perform a single codes_table combination.

    -   The codes tables can remain separate, but it would
        require more write scripts.
    -   If I combine them into a single table, they could be more
        manageable on the import.
    -   However, I may not need to import these into my database.
        They may only be needed while visualizing the findings,
        in which case I can wait until I import them to Tableau.
        TBD.

### Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)

#### Visual Studio 2022 + SQL

-   Created three tables uk_accidents uk_vehicles uk_casualties

uk_accidents

```{sql uk_accidents, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

-   Importing Accidents 2016 ran into an issue with Speed Limit
    column, where there were strings of NULL instead of true null
    values.

    -   Same issue with the 2017 Accidents in the Lat/Long
        columns.
    -   In Power Query, I ran a find/replace NULL for "" on the
        entire workbook.

-   Accidents table: Date

    -   Dates were formatted as text in dd/mm/yyyy format. When
        importing and converting, they were truncated. Niether
        Excel or SQL were playing nicely with this format.
    -   In Power Query, I ran a transformation and re-saved the
        CSVs.
    -   After some difficulty getting dates formatting, and a bit
        of help from Google and ChatGPT-4, the dates finally
        worked out.
    -   The final CSV format was yyyy-mm-dd, then imported into
        my database as a VARCHAR
    -   Then the final conversion was performed in SQL.

```{sql date-issue, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

/* 
I had a lot of trouble with the Date column 
but finally manged to run through steps in Power Query and SQL
that worked.
*/
--DROP TABLE uk_accidents
--Date VARCHAR(15),
--Date DATE,

SELECT Date 
FROM uk_accidents 
WHERE ISDATE(Date) = 0


-- Update the Date column to swap the day and month
UPDATE uk_accidents
SET Date = CONCAT(
    SUBSTRING(Date, 1, 4), '-', -- Year
    SUBSTRING(Date, 9, 2), '-', -- Day
    SUBSTRING(Date, 6, 2)      -- Month
)
WHERE ISDATE(Date) = 0;


ALTER TABLE uk_accidents ADD Date_New DATE;

UPDATE uk_accidents SET Date_New = CAST(Date AS DATE);

--UPDATE uk_accidents SET Date_New = CONVERT(DATE, Date, 103);  -- 103 is for dd/mm/yyyy format

ALTER TABLE uk_accidents DROP COLUMN Date;

EXEC sp_rename 'uk_accidents.Date_New', 'Date', 'COLUMN';

```

-   Checking for duplicates in the other tables revealed that
    while there are duplicate Accident_Index IDs, they are not
    duplicate observations. Each row is a unique observation.

    -   Running the following script is an example of how they
        are not actually duplicates:

```{sql check-dups, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
  WITH CTE_CheckDupsC AS (
    SELECT *
--    c.Accident_Index
--,   c.Casualty_Reference
,    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Accident_Index, Casualty_Reference ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS rn
  FROM uk_casualties AS c
  )

  SELECT *
  FROM CTE_CheckDupsC
 WHERE Accident_Index = '201604ED16270'
-- WHERE rn > 1
  ORDER BY CTE_CheckDupsC.Accident_Index
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Analysis Roadmap

1.  Understand the Data: Make notes about each variable, what is
    it, what signficance does it hold, what potential
    calculations or analysis can be done on them.

2.  Generate Hypotheses: What relationships, correlations, can we
    expect to find? Are accidents higher in certain regions, road
    conditions, etc? Are certain vehicles more likely to be in an
    accident?

3.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using SQL, R, and Tableau to
    analyze the datasets, we summarize the data and find
    patterns. Min, Max, Sum, Count, Mean, Median, etc. will be
    helpful.

4.  Visualization: Once we have some key insights, start creating
    visualizations (first in R, then in Tableau) to see if
    anything visually stands out as interesting or if a story
    begins to emerge.

5.  Story Drafting: Draft the narrative around these findings.
    What story is the data telling? Why is it important? What
    recommendations or observations can we make?

6.  Review and Refine: Review the data story several times,
    refine it to make sure it's compelling and understandable.
    Are the visualizations telling the story on their own?

7.  Presentation: Put all these findings into a presentation
    format. Keep it simple but informative. Use your
    visualizations to support your story. Keep the script out of
    the visualizations themselves but in a presentable format for
    those who are not able to attend the presentation.

Questions to Consider:

Conditions

-   Roads: Wet/Dry, Urban/Rural, Maintained/Deferred-Maintenance,

-   Cities, Regions, Police Depts, Deprivation Index, do any of
    these show higher accidents or lower?

-   Are any types of crossings or conditions more likely to cause
    accidents?

-   Do Seasons, Days, Times of Day, Light, or Weather play a
    role?

People

-   Does Poverty index, age, sex, or any other human factor play
    a role in accidents?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Analysis

#### R & RStudio

Transitioning to RStudio for Analysis

-----------------------------------------------------------------

##### Connecting to R RStudio

Loading Libraries

```{r libraries, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

# LOAD LIBRARIES
library(DBI)
library(odbc)
library(RODBC)
library(tidyverse)
#library(dplyr)
#library(ggplot2)
#library(scales)
library(sqldf)
#library(ggmap)
#library(geosphere)
#library(here)
#library(skimr)
#library(janitor)
#library(Tmisc)

```

Connecting R & RStudio to the database

```{r connecting-to-r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# ESTABLISH CONNECTION TO MY LOCAL DATABASE

connection <- odbcDriverConnect("driver={SQL Server};server=LAPTOP-76LHVPRQ\\SQLEXPRESS;database=UK_RoadSafety;trusted_connection=true")

```

-----------------------------------------------------------------

##### Assign Dataframes

Assigning the new cleaned database tables as R dataframes:

-   UK_AccidentData

-   UK_CasualtyData

-   UK_VehicleData

```{r dataframe-accident, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

# ASSIGN THE DATABASE TABLE AS A DATAFRAME (df) VARIABLE FOR EASIER RECALL

UK_AccidentData <- sqlFetch(connection, "dbo.uk_accidents")

UK_CasualtyData <- sqlFetch(connection, "dbo.uk_casualties")

UK_VehicleData <- sqlFetch(connection, "dbo.uk_vehicles")

```

-----------------------------------------------------------------

##### Column Names (Variables)

-   What variables do each dataset contain?
-   How are they related?
-   What might they tell us?

The Accident Index acts as a key. The Accident Table is the key
table, there is one Accident Index for each observation (row) in
this table. The Casualty and Vehicle tables refer back to this
Accident Index key to tie their data into specific accidents. The
Number of Vehicles and Number of Casualties are essentially a
count of the other related data from the other two tables.

The Vehicle Reference builds on the Accident Index. It is
contained in both the Vehicle Table and Casualty Table. For each
accident, individual vehicles are numbered (Vehicle 1, Vehicle 2,
etc.). This allows us to see how many vehicles were involved in
any given accident (from the Vehicle Table) while maintaining a
simple Accident Index in the origin table. The Casualty Table can
then assign the casualty to which vehicle was involved in that
injury.

The Casualty Reference only exists on the Casualty Table, and
serves as an index for the individual who was injured.

There are also Key Tables/Codes Tables. During my work in R, I
will reference them via CSV/Excel to understand what each one is,
as I do not need them for determining averages or means or
counts. However, when visualizing this data, I will import these
into Tableau in a star schema for more accurate labeling.

```{r dataframe-column-names, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

colnames(UK_AccidentData)

colnames(UK_CasualtyData)

colnames(UK_VehicleData)

```

-----------------------------------------------------------------

##### UK_Road Safety Data Summary

In comparing certain variable's mean and median, we can make some
preliminary statements.

Summary of UK Accidents

-   Accident Severity Code 3 is Slight. The Median (3) and Mean
    (2.81) indicate that the average accident only presents
    Slight injuries.

-   Most accidents involve two vehicles and do involve at least
    one injury.

-   Day of Week: I'd like to see a visual count on this for the
    "difference" but most accidents occur on a Wednesday (Median
    4, Mean 4.104, Code 4 is Wednesday).

-   The Mean (37.64) and Median (30) speed limits may indicate
    the "average" accident occurs at these lower limits. However,
    a count graphic may indicate whether there was a slight
    difference or major difference in accidents counts for each
    limit range.

-   Light Conditions. Code 1 is light, Codes 4-7 indicate various
    lighting conditions in the dark. The Median (1) and Mean
    (1.993) may indicate the average accident occurs during the
    day or with good lighting. Graphing this data may help
    illuminate this key.

-   Weather Conditions. Code 1 is Fine. Codes 2-8 are other than
    fine. 9 is unknown. Median (1) and Mean (1.579) indicate
    weather is not a major influence "on average", but graphing
    this will show any trends or difference in the data.

-   Police Attendance would be an after-the-fact variable, so
    while it may indicate the seriousness of the accident, it
    would not be predictive in any way for preventing accidents.
    That being said, it does appear the police were involved in
    the average accident, Median (1), Mean (1.251), with Code 1
    being Yes, and Code 2 being No.

Summary of UK Acc*ident Casualty*

*Note: By "Casualty", this dataset means "Injury" not necessarily
"Death". They are segregated into Fatality, Serious, and Slight.*

-   Sex of Casualty Code 1, Male, Code 2, Female. Median (1),
    Mean (1.406); this does not tell me much right now. I'd like
    to see the data visualized and see if this acts as a
    component against or with other variables.

-   Age of Casualty: Median 33, Mean 36.48. This does seem to
    indicate something. Although, this is the prime working age,
    so it's possible this has to do with the number of humans in
    this age range in the vicinity and not anything to do with
    their driving. High probability with higher representation.
    As with the other table, when a casualty is involved, it
    appears to be serious or slight, but Fatalities are not the
    average. Although, with the Insurance rates higher for
    "teens" I would have expected this to trend that direction. I
    would like to see the full variable visualized.

-   Pedestrian Location & Movement reflect Median of 0, and Mean
    of 0.714/0.5418. Pedestrians are rarely involved.

-   Road Maintenance workers are rarely involved. Although, if a
    road working company wanted to analyze the data for
    situations in which they could reduce their workers being
    hurt, they could slice the data for only these situations and
    see what trends emerge.

-   Home Area (1 Urban, 2 Small Town, 3 Rural) - Urban cities
    seem to be the average place for accidents.

-   IMD 4 / 3.714 may indicate a trend toward more casualties in
    mid-lower income regions? Needs further visualization
    analysis.

Summary of UK Vehicles in Accidents

-   Vehicle Type 9/9.804 is Car. Most people on most trips are in
    a car, so this holds to the expected pattern. Could be
    interesting to visualize this data variable to see what the
    second or third most common types are. Motorcycle, Van, Taxi,
    etc.

-   !!! Manoeuvre (Reversing, Parked, Waiting, Slowing, U-Turn,
    etc.). Anecdotally, when I was a young driver most of my
    accidents were in parking lots while reversing. I later
    learned this is common for ADHD neurotypes. This may be
    interesting to follow.

-   Vehicle Location Median 0 means the central data point is on
    the main roads. Not surprising.

-   Junction Median of 1 (Approaching or waiting at a junction)
    may indicate this is a common place for accidents. I was
    rear-ended more than once while waiting at a stoplight.

-   Journey or Purpose Unknown (6) may make this a useless
    variable?

-   Several variables show no indication of relevance, all being
    zero median.

-   Age of Driver (35/35.49) matches the Casualty table.
    Interesting.

-   Propulsion Code - Mostly Gasoline/Petrol cars. Not shocking.

-   Age of Vehicle - Average car was 5.569 years old. That's may
    be a reflection of the average age of cars in general, and
    may only be relevant to the accident data if this was
    compared to the general average age of cars in the UK. If
    they were divergent, then it would be relevant. Otherwise it
    is a reflection and not indicative of anything useful.

-   Engine Capacity CC - Median (1390), Mean (1422) actually mean
    nothing to me because I don't know anything about Engine CCs
    or how that's relevant. And as with Age of Vehicle, may be a
    reflection and not an indication.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### New Questions

Based on the summary review, here are some questions to pursue.

-   Accidents Table
    -   How many accidents involve 0, 1, 2, or more vehicles?
    -   How many accidents involve a casualty/injury of any kind?
    -   How many accidents occur at various speed limit ranges?
    -   How many accidents occur on which days of the week?
    -   How many accidents occur at various light conditions?
    -   How many accidents occur at various weather conditions?
    -   How many accidents for each IMD?
-   Casualty Table
    -   How many casualties for each sex/gender?
    -   How many casualties for each age band?
    -   How many casualties for each Home Areas?
    -   How many casualties for each IMD?
-   Vehicles Table
    -   How many of each vehicle type? We know cars are most
        common, but which are 2nd or 3rd?
    -   Which Manoeuvres are most common?
    -   Besides main roads, which other Locations are common?
    -   Explore variables, see what else sticks out.

### UK_AccidentData Variable Analysis

The following represents a look at the counts for occurrences of
variables in the UK_AccidentData dataset. Comments above each
represent findings.

```{r accident-variables, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

# No Intersection & T Intersections are most common accident types.
# That is surprising, given the MPH 30 thing? Let's look at MPH, Junctions, and Time. 

UK_AccidentData %>% 
  count(Junction_Detail)

# Mostly missing data (-1)
UK_AccidentData %>% 
  count(Junction_Control)

# Mostly missing data (-1), filter these out.
# With (-1, missing data) filtered out, these show a strong preference for 4.
# Uncontroled intersections lead the way.
UK_AccidentData %>% 
  filter(Junction_Control != -1) %>% 
  count(Junction_Control)

# One lane roads dominate
UK_AccidentData %>% 
  count(Road_Type)

# Most accidents (383,735) occurred on dry roads.
# 2nd Most (131,236) on wet roads.
# As these are the two most common road conditions, that is only so helpful to know.
UK_AccidentData %>% 
  count(Road_Surface_Conditions)

# Roughly 3/4 of accidents had a Police Officer
# Roughly 1/4 did not
# A fraction had no police officer but did self-report via a form.
UK_AccidentData %>% 
  count(Did_Police_Officer_Attend_Scene_of_Accident)


```

-----------------------------------------------------------------

### UK_CasualtyData Variable Analysis

The following represents a look at the counts for occurrences of
variables in the UK_CasualtyData dataset. Comments above each
represent findings.

```{r casualty-variables, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

# UK_CasualtyData 
  
colnames(UK_CasualtyData)

# Roughly double M vs F
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Sex_of_Casualty)
  
# The data set is too long, using age bands is better.
# Unlike the Time in the Accident table, this one is already grouped.
#UK_CasualtyData %>% 
 # count(Age_of_Casualty)

# Probably a bell curve? 
# Highest at 6 (26-35) and 7 (36-45) with tapering on both sides.
# Probably a reflection of the age average among the general population.
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Age_Band_of_Casualty)

# Casualties roughly divided between Vehicle 1 & 2
# Some casualties in multi-car crashes, with fewer and fewer the more cars involved.
# As expected.
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Vehicle_Reference)

# Most casualties "Not Car Passenger"? 
# Does that mean they weren't in THIS car, or weren't in any car?
# Does that mean most were pedestrians? But that doesn't align with other data?
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Car_Passenger)

# Most (vast majority) not a Pedestrian, as stated above.
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Pedestrian_Location)

# Most (vast majority) not a Pedestrian, as stated above.
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Pedestrian_Movement)

# Vast majority not a bus or coach passenger, as expected.

# Driver 450,659
# Passenger 154,656
# Pedestrian 93,848
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Casualty_Class)

# Fatality 7,099
# Seriously Injured 96,587 
# Slight Injury 595,477
# This rings true to logic, but I actually thought fatalities would have been higher.
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Casualty_Severity)

# At least 347 road workers died 2015-2018
# While small, that's not nothing given the population size.
UK_CasualtyData %>% 
  count(Pedestrian_Road_Maintenance_Worker)


```

### UK_VehicleData Variable Analysis

The following represents a look at the counts for occurrences of
variables in the UK_VehicleData dataset. Comments above each

UK_VehicleData %>% 
  count(Vehicle_Leaving_Carriageway)

#Defining Unfamiliar Terms: 
# - **Nearside**: This is the side of the vehicle closest to the curb or side of the road. 

# In the UK, where driving is on the left-hand side of the road, 
#   the nearside would be the left side of the vehicle.

# - **Offside**: This is the side of the vehicle that is closest to the middle of the road. 
#     In the UK, this would be the right side of the vehicle.

# These terms are used to describe where a vehicle left the carriageway 
#   (i.e., the main part of the road). For example:
# - **"Nearside"**: The vehicle left the road and ended up on the side closest to the curb.
# - **"Offside"**: The vehicle left the road and ended up on the side closest to the middle of the road 
#   or possibly even crossed to the opposite side.

# Related to side, left-handed or not?
# Most were, in the UK where almost all cars were, no shockers here.
UK_VehicleData %>% 
  count(Was_Vehicle_Left_Hand_Drive)

# Most firs point of impact was front.
# This makes sense as there were a lot more vehicle one (529,172)
# than there were vehicle two (373,763) accidents.
# This means a significant amount were single car accidents striking something else.

By joining the tables on the Primary Key correlations reference
keys, we might be able to see some interesting overlaps or
correlations.

### Visualizations in Tableau

Initial Analysis and Views complete for now with a handful of key
insights. I really want to see the data in visualizations. I
saved the three cleaned tables as CSVs, as well as a few key
views that might be interesting.

I will port these plus the codes tables to Tableau and see what
happens when we begin visualizing these insights and looking for
stuff I cannot do in R (because Google maps requires a paid API
to use the plot map in R).

TBD...
