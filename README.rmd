#UK Road Safety Data

-----------------------------------------------------------------

###Important Information

The UKRoadSafetyData.zip was provided to me to use as test data for analysis practice and demonstration of my skillset.

Instructions: "Ultimately the goal is to show us something interesting via a dashboard/report using your favorite tools in an approximately 20-minute presentation. There is no traditional “right answer”, we are looking for how you work with data and communicate insights."

Specifically, I was to analyze the dataset(s) for anything interesting, build a presentation, and highlight my abilities in the following areas:

-  ETL Process  
  +  (see the .Rmd file: Technical Review)
-  Data Visualizations 
  +  (see the Tableau Public Link and associated Power Point Presentation).
-  Data Modeling
  +  (see the .Rmd file, GitHub SQL folders, and the Schematic in the Power Point).
-  Time Management
  +  (see the write up in the Power Point).
